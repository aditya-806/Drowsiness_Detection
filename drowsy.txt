in this code we have used CNN(Convolution neural networks) algo
we have used opencv and many other libraries in it like dlib, scipy_spatial,imutils,face utils,pygame
scipy.spatial.distance is used to compute the distance between eyes
EAR is the eye aspect ratio
threshold time is 0.25 total frames are 20 if the value of threshold is less than 0.25 then it will make you alert and a sound will compe
